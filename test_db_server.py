    #           the result.  Use that result to call the ".delete()" method of
    #           the MongoModel-type class to remove the entry from the MongoDB
    #           database, then assert that the saved name matches the name
    #           sent in this test.

    # Option 2: function being tested does not return a Patient instance.  So,
    #           call function.  Then, separately query database for the
    #           record which should have been added.  Delete that record in
    #           the MongoDB database, then assert that the found record name
    #           matched the name sent in this test.

    # Overall approach to writing a test of database functions:
    # 1. Set up the data base with the needed data
    # 2. Run code that you want to test
    # 3. Clean up database
    # 4. Assert
